## Steps we took to complete project

###ETL ("Clean Up") the Data -
 
```{r ETL,eval = FALSE}

```
###Data Description

###Joining the Data

We joined the data using a inner join to combine states with their respective regions. 


```{}
SELECT Wages1.unique_num,school, wage, exper, sex, marital status, state
        FROM Wages1, `Wages2.csv`
        WHERE Wages1.unique_num = `Wages2.csv`.unique_num
```

## Shiny
  After we had workable data, we developed a Shiny App. Each tab of the Shiny App displays the equivalent ggplot code that creates the same visualization as Tableau. 
  
If you wish to run the app, it is under 02 Shiny. It is also hosted with this URL. https://chriswongwr.shinyapps.io/project6/
